The file _run_analysis.R_ contains a script that will generate the desired results, that is two datasets, named _tbl_ and _avgs_, containing tidy datasets displaying data from a wearable computing experiment, the first has selected variables and all the observations, whereas the second contains the same variables but averaged so that only one observation remains for each individual engaging in each activity.

The _CodeBook_ file details each variable that is displayed in the final tables.
