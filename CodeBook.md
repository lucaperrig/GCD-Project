# Codebook

There are two datasets in this repo, tbl and avgs. Il will address each in turn.

## tbl

This table displays the means and standard deviations of accelerations and orientation along three axes recorded on 30 patients in six different positions. The measures were taken 27 times for each patient in each position.

Variables:
*labels is a categorical displaying the activity (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, and laying)
*subject displays the individual taking the test. Each person has a number from 1 to 30.
*The following variables are indicating the type of measure that is taken, notably whether it is acceleration or orientation. The labels are set such that if it contains "mean" it is an average, and if it contains "std" it is a standard deviation.

## avgs

This table displays the averages of the 27 means and standard deviations of accelerations and orientation along three axes recorded on 30 patients in six different positions.

Variables:
*labels is a categorical displaying the activity (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, and laying)
*subject displays the individual taking the test. Each person has a number from 1 to 30.
*The following variables are indicating the type of measure that is taken, notably whether it is acceleration or orientation. The labels are set such that if it contains "mean" it is an average, and if it contains "std" it is a standard deviation.
